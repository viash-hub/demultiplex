# demultiplex x.y.z

## Major updates
The outflow of the workflow has been refactored to be more flexible. The logic is as follows:

- If no `id` is provided, the output directory is set to `$publish_dir/demultiplex_<version>`.
- If an `id` is explicitly set using Seqera Cloud or by adding `--id <>`, the output directory is set to `$publish_dir/<id>`.

The workflow has two optional flags to be used in combination with `--id`:

- `--add_date_time`: rather than publishing the results under `$publish_dir`, this adds an additional layer `$publish_dir/<date-time-stamp>/`. This is useful when you want to keep track of multiple runs of the workflow (example: `240322_143020`).
- `--add_workflow_identifier`: adding this flag will add `_demultiplex_<version>` to the output directory (example: `demultiplex_v0.2.0`). When starting the workflow from a non-release, the version will be set to `version_unkonwn`.

The structure in the output directory is:

- Two sub-directories:
  - `fastq`
  - `qc` for the reports:
    - `multiqc_report.html`
    - `fastqc/` directory containing the different fastqc (falco) reports.

The `$publish_dir` variable corresponds to the argument provided with `--publish-dir`. The `date-time-stamp` is generated by the workflow based on when it was launched and is thus guaranteed to be unique.
