# demultiplex v0.2.x

## Major updates
The outflow of the workflow has been refactored and the (Viash) default approach for publishing artifacts has been overridden.

The output structure is now:

- `$publish_dir/<data-time-stamp>/`
- Two sub-directories:
  - `fastq`
  - `qc` for the reports:
    - `multiqc_report.html`
    - `fastqc/` directory containing the different fastqc (falco) reports.
- Example date-time stamp: `240322_143020`

The `$publish_dir` variable corresponds to the argument provided with `--publish-dir`. The `date-time-stamp` is generated by the workflow based on when it was launched. It is guaranteed to be unique.
